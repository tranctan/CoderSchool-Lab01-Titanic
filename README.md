# CoderSchool-Lab01-Titanic

This is the first lab assignment of CoderSchool working on Titanic dataset. As suggested by our teacher, i mainly referenced the tutorial on Kaggle - [Interactive Data Science Tutorial](https://www.kaggle.com/helgejo/an-interactive-data-science-tutorial).

Within this work, I plotted some fundamental graphs and manually built a decision tree based on previous examples in class. During the implementation, i found out that there 2 types of variables and each needs their own appropriate graphs. Also, i built a decision tree employed from [Scikit-Learn](http://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/tree.html). Finally, i extracted additional information from variable that i was confused initally and it showed that accuracy can be enhanced with addition information from Title.
